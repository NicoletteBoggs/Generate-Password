# GeneratePassword

For this project I:
Created a series of prompts for password criteria.
Created an array of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols that the user is able to randomly customize.
Generated the final password in the box after all selected criteria was submitted.

How:
First I made an array of numbers, symbols, and letters.
Then I used window.prompt and window.confirm to ask the user to follow the prompts/criteria.
"If" functions used to include what the user selected to keep in their password.
Finally, console.log and return to randomly generate a password using the selected criteria, and return the final password to the user.
